## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
![Framework Joke][coverlibrarie]
_Framework:_
JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript which in turn all perform certain separate functions. They can be used for the development of other JavaScript without the developer having to write his own JavaScript for the functions the library provides him with.

_Libraries:_
A library is an unopinionated piece of software which implements a certain functionality with a defined API a developer can call from their application.

**Pro’s:**
- Efficiency — projects that used to take months and hundreds of lines of code now can be achieved much faster with well-structured prebuilt patterns and functions.
- Usage — Super easy to use.
- Safety — top JavaScript frameworks have firm security arrangements and are supported by large communities where members and users also act as testers.
- Cost — most frameworks are open source and free. Since they help programmers to build custom solutions faster, the ultimate price for web app will be lower.
- Community — An excellent framework has a well-established community as well as support documentation in order, thereby allowing you to refer to the docs or seek help from members of the community if you run into a problem or encounter a bug.
 

**Cons:**
- Memory — owing to a large set of powerful features, most frameworks tend to be bulky regarding functions and code base. It takes up a lot of memory.
- Learning — You don't learn the deep-down JavaScript code because you're using shortcut functions within the framework.
- Lifetime — Frameworks/libraries die all the time. It must be we-written sooner or later. 
- Loading — The loading times are way slower than Vanilla JS.
- Browser — Quite a few frameworks rely on browser detection.
- Editing — The framework’s core behavior can’t be modified, meaning that when you use a framework, you are forced to respect its limits and work the way it is required.
- Bugs —  a bug within a library can be difficult to locate and fix.
